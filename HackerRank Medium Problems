Challenge: "The PADS"

Generate the following two result sets: 
1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS immediately
followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical. For example:
AnActorName(A), ADoctorName (D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S). 

2. Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort 
the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 
"There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.", where occupation_count
is the number of occurrences in an occpuation in OCCUPATIONS and occupation is the
lowercase occupation name. If more than one occupation has the same 
occupation_count, they should be ordered alphabetically. 

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
